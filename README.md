My bachelor's degree thesis.

Nuclear medicine imaging browser
Abstract. The purpose of nuclear medicine is diagnosing and treating various diseases
using radioactive isotopes. Supported by appropriate devices, there is a possibility to
register results of particular examination as image. Nowadays, a large amount of medical
information is stored in DICOMformat. The standard allows the exchange of data not only
betweenmedical devices but also unprofessional equipment, such as handheld devices:
tablets, smartphones, PCs. As a result one can observe results of different examinations
on their own phone or laptop. Since DICOM format is not supported by operative systems
in most cases, there is a necessity of using proper software to deal with the problem. For
this purpose, browsers allowing extraction of data fromDICOM files and itsâ€™ analysis are
created. The goal of the thesis is to create a desktop application achieving tasks mentioned
above. Moreover, the viewer will make measurements on displayed images resulting with
physical units possible.
